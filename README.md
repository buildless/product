## Buildless

> Product planning and roadmapping

This repository is where the [Elide team](https://elide.dev) plans out development for [Buildless](https://less.build). We do this in public so our dev users can provide feedback when they want to.


### What is Buildless?

[Buildless](https://less.build) is a remote build cache CDN, which works as a drop-in backend with **Gradle**, **Maven**, **Bazel**, **CCache**, and more. You can learn more from our [site](https://less.build), our [docs](https://docs.less.build), or on our [GitHub](https://github.com/buildless).
